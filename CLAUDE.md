# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **fhirpath-rs** (octofhir-fhirpath), a high-performance FHIRPath implementation in Rust for healthcare data processing. It provides a complete implementation of the FHIRPath expression language for FHIR resources with **90.9% specification compliance** (1003/1104 tests passing).

## Architecture

### Modular Workspace Structure
The project uses 9 specialized crates for flexibility and maintainability:

```
crates/
â”œâ”€â”€ octofhir-fhirpath/     # Main library (re-exports everything)
â”œâ”€â”€ fhirpath-core/         # Core types, errors, evaluation results
â”œâ”€â”€ fhirpath-ast/          # Abstract syntax tree definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ fhirpath-parser/       # Tokenizer and parser (nom-based)
â”œâ”€â”€ fhirpath-evaluator/    # Expression evaluation engine
â”œâ”€â”€ fhirpath-model/        # Value types and FHIR data model
â”œâ”€â”€ fhirpath-registry/     # Function and operator registry
â”œâ”€â”€ fhirpath-analyzer/     # Static analysis and validation
â””â”€â”€ fhirpath-diagnostics/  # Error handling and reporting
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Performance**: Zero-copy parsing, arena allocation, efficient data structures
2. **Safety**: 100% memory-safe Rust, no unsafe blocks
3. **Async-First**: ModelProvider architecture supports async operations without over-engineering
4. **Thread-Safe**: Full Send + Sync support for FhirPathEngine
5. **Modular**: Clean separation via workspace crates
6. **Simplicity**: Clean, maintainable code without unnecessary overhead or complexity

### JSON Processing
**Important**: This codebase uses `serde_json::Value` for all JSON processing. Maintain consistency by always using `serde_json` throughout the codebase. Do not introduce other JSON libraries unless there is a compelling performance or compatibility reason.

## Development Patterns

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each crate has comprehensive unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-crate functionality testing
- **Specification Compliance**: 1104 official FHIRPath tests (90.9% pass rate)
- **Performance Tests**: Automated benchmarking and regression detection
- Always run `just test-coverage` to update compliance report

### Code Quality Standards
- **Zero Warnings**: All clippy warnings must be resolved
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must have doc comments
- **Formatting**: Uses rustfmt with 100-character line limit
- **Performance**: Maintain 100K+ ops/sec for parser, 1K+ ops/sec for evaluator

### Error Handling
- Uses comprehensive diagnostic system with source location tracking
- All errors include helpful context and suggestions
- Parser has error recovery capabilities

### FHIRPath Function Implementation
When implementing new FHIRPath functions:
1. Add function to appropriate category in `fhirpath-registry/src/operations/`
2. Register in the registry with proper signature
3. Add comprehensive tests including edge cases
4. Update test coverage by running official test suites
5. Consider performance implications and add benchmarks if needed

### Performance Considerations  
- Use `SmallVec` for small collections to avoid heap allocation
- Prefer arena allocation in evaluation contexts
- Profile with `just bench` before and after changes
- Memory usage is critical for large Bundle resources

### CLI Development
The main binary is in `crates/octofhir-fhirpath/src/bin/octofhir-fhirpath.rs`. All CLI functionality should use the unified FhirPathEngine and provide consistent output formatting.

## Testing and Validation

### Running Tests
- `just test` - All tests
- `just test-official` - Official FHIRPath specification tests  
- `cargo test specific_test_name -- --nocapture` - Individual test with output
- `cargo test --package crate-name` - Tests for specific crate

### Test Coverage
Current status: **90.9%** (1003/1104 tests passing)
- Run `just test-coverage` to update TEST_COVERAGE.md
- Focus on improving coverage in areas marked ðŸŸ  or ðŸ”´ in test report
- All new functionality must include tests

### Performance Benchmarks
- `just bench` provides comprehensive performance metrics
- Parser target: 100K+ operations/second  
- Evaluator target: 1K+ operations/second with Bundle resolution
- Memory efficiency is crucial for healthcare applications

## Environment Variables

### Development
- `RUST_LOG=debug` - Enable debug logging
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` - Enable backtraces
- `FHIRPATH_USE_MOCK_PROVIDER=1` - Use MockModelProvider for faster testing

### CLI Usage
- `FHIRPATH_MODEL` - Default model provider (mock, r4, r5)
- `FHIRPATH_TIMEOUT` - Default timeout in seconds
- `NO_COLOR` - Disable colored output

## Key Files and Directories

- `justfile` - All development commands
- `Cargo.toml` - Workspace configuration with sonic_rs, tokio, and healthcare-specific dependencies
- `specs/fhirpath/tests/` - Official FHIRPath test suite (1104 tests)
- `TEST_COVERAGE.md` - Auto-generated compliance report
- `benchmark.md` - Performance benchmark results
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed technical architecture
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- `CLI.md` - Complete CLI reference

## Special Considerations

### FHIRPath Compliance
- Follow FHIRPath specification exactly (http://hl7.org/fhirpath/)
- Any deviations must be documented with rationale
- Test against official test suites regularly
- Current focus: improving from 90.9% to 95%+ compliance

### Healthcare Data Processing
- Large Bundle resources are common (hundreds of entries)
- Reference resolution across Bundle entries is critical
- Type safety and validation are essential for medical data
- Performance matters for high-throughput healthcare systems

### ModelProvider Architecture
Starting from v0.3.0, ModelProvider is mandatory:
- `MockModelProvider` - Fast, simple provider for development/testing
- `FhirSchemaModelProvider` - Full FHIR R4/R5 schema integration
- Async operations for external data fetching
- Caching is essential for performance

**Critical**: Do NOT hardcode FHIR properties, choice types, or resource types in ModelProvider implementations. All FHIR schema information (properties, types, choices, resource definitions) MUST be dynamically retrieved from FHIRSchema. This ensures:
- Accurate compliance with official FHIR specifications
- Support for all FHIR versions and profiles
- Automatic updates when FHIR schemas change
- Consistency with the broader FHIR ecosystem

### Release Process
- Run `just release-prep` for complete quality assurance
- Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
- Use semantic versioning (currently v0.4.x)
- All releases require 90%+ test compliance

## Current Priorities

1. **Improve FHIRPath compliance** from 90.9% to 95%+
2. **Optimize performance** for complex expressions on large Bundles  
3. **Enhance error messages** with better diagnostics
4. **Complete missing functions** (see TEST_COVERAGE.md for specifics)
5. **Add analyzer integration** for static analysis capabilities

## Development Philosophy

**Develop as a Professional Rust Developer and FHIR Expert:**
- Write idiomatic, clean Rust code that follows best practices
- Apply deep FHIR domain knowledge to design decisions
- Prioritize async-first architecture without over-engineering or unnecessary overhead
- Keep the codebase simple, readable, and maintainable
- Focus on performance and correctness without sacrificing code clarity
- Use established patterns and avoid premature optimization
- Ensure all code is production-ready and enterprise-grade

## Integration Notes

This codebase integrates with broader healthcare ecosystem:
- Uses octofhir-* family of healthcare crates
- Compatible with FHIR R4 and R5 specifications
- Designed for integration with EHR systems and healthcare APIs
- Thread-safe for server applications
