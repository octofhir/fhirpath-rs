# Phase 1: Workspace Setup and Core Crate Creation

## Overview
Set up the Cargo workspace structure and create the foundational crates with proper dependency management.

## Tasks

### 1.1 Create Workspace Structure
- [x] Create `Cargo.toml` workspace configuration
- [x] Create `crates/` directory structure
- [x] Set up workspace dependencies and version management
- [x] Configure workspace-level lint settings

### 1.2 Create fhirpath-core Crate
- [x] Create `crates/fhirpath-core/Cargo.toml`
- [x] Move core types from `src/types.rs`
- [x] Move core error types from `src/error.rs`
- [x] Create foundational traits and abstractions
- [x] Set up proper re-exports

### 1.3 Create fhirpath-ast Crate
- [x] Create `crates/fhirpath-ast/Cargo.toml`
- [x] Move `src/ast/` module content
- [x] Add dependency on `fhirpath-core`
- [x] Update imports and re-exports
- [x] Ensure all AST visitor patterns work

### 1.4 Create fhirpath-diagnostics Crate
- [x] Create `crates/fhirpath-diagnostics/Cargo.toml`
- [x] Move `src/diagnostics/` module content
- [x] Add dependency on `fhirpath-core`
- [x] Update error handling and diagnostic reporting
- [x] Preserve LSP support functionality

### 1.5 Update Root Crate Dependencies
- [x] Update root `Cargo.toml` to depend on new crates
- [x] Update `src/lib.rs` to re-export from crates
- [x] Ensure public API remains unchanged
- [x] Run tests to verify functionality

## Success Criteria
- [x] Workspace builds successfully
- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] Public API remains unchanged
- [x] Core crates have clean dependencies
- [x] Documentation builds correctly

## Estimated Time: 1-2 days

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Created Cargo.toml workspace configuration with proper dependency management
- [x] Created crates/ directory structure with all Phase 1 crates
- [x] Created fhirpath-core crate with core types (FhirPathError, FhirTypeRegistry)
- [x] Created fhirpath-ast crate with AST definitions and visitor pattern
- [x] Created fhirpath-diagnostics crate with error handling and LSP support
- [x] Updated root crate to depend on new workspace crates
- [x] Verified workspace builds successfully with proper re-exports
- [x] Fixed all import issues and dependency conflicts

### Workspace Successfully Builds:
- All 4 crates compile without errors
- Proper workspace dependency management
- Clean re-export structure maintained
- Public API preserved

**Ready for Phase 2: Parser and Model Migration**
