# Multi-Crate Migration Checklist

## Migration Overview
Complete migration from single-crate to multi-crate workspace architecture for improved compilation times and maintainability.

## Phase Execution Checklist

### ✅ Phase 1: Workspace Setup and Core Crate Creation
- [ ] Workspace configuration
- [ ] fhirpath-core crate
- [ ] fhirpath-ast crate  
- [ ] fhirpath-diagnostics crate
- [ ] Root crate integration
- [ ] **Target:** 831 tests passing

### ✅ Phase 2: Parser and Model Crate Migration
- [ ] fhirpath-parser crate
- [ ] fhirpath-model crate
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance validation
- [ ] **Target:** Parser and model isolation complete

### ✅ Phase 3: Registry and Compiler Crate Migration
- [ ] fhirpath-registry crate (all 100+ functions)
- [ ] fhirpath-compiler crate
- [ ] Extension system preservation
- [ ] Performance optimization validation
- [ ] **Target:** All functions and bytecode VM working

### ✅ Phase 4: Evaluator and Main Crate Migration
- [ ] fhirpath-evaluator crate
- [ ] Move octofhir-fhirpath to crates/ folder
- [ ] CLI binary preservation
- [ ] Engine integration
- [ ] **Target:** Complete functionality preserved

### ✅ Phase 5: Tools and Benchmarks Crates
- [ ] fhirpath-tools crate (test coverage)
- [ ] fhirpath-benchmarks crate
- [ ] Build system updates
- [ ] **Target:** Development workflow enhanced

### ✅ Phase 6: Final Optimization and Validation
- [ ] Compilation performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline updates
- [ ] **Target:** <80% build time, all tests passing

## Critical Success Metrics

### Functionality Preservation
- [ ] All 831 currently passing official tests still pass
- [ ] 82.7% FHIRPath specification compliance maintained
- [ ] CLI functionality identical
- [ ] Public API completely unchanged
- [ ] All 100+ built-in functions working

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Tokenizer: 10M+ operations/second
- [ ] Parser: 1M+ operations/second  
- [ ] Evaluator: Context operations optimized
- [ ] Workspace build time: <80% of original
- [ ] Individual crate build: <50% of full build

### Architecture Benefits
- [ ] Independent crate development possible
- [ ] Parallel compilation achieved
- [ ] Clean dependency graph
- [ ] Enhanced developer experience
- [ ] Maintainable codebase structure

## Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Backup current working state before each phase
- [ ] Run tests after each major migration step
- [ ] Validate performance benchmarks throughout
- [ ] Preserve all existing functionality
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

## Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] `just build` - workspace builds successfully
- [ ] `just test` - all tests pass
- [ ] `just test-official` - 831 official tests pass
- [ ] `just bench` - benchmarks run and perform well
- [ ] `just test-coverage` - coverage generation works
- [ ] `just cli-evaluate "Patient.name"` - CLI works
- [ ] Individual crate builds work independently

## Timeline Estimate: 10-15 days total
- Phase 1-2: 3-5 days (foundation)
- Phase 3-4: 5-7 days (core migration)  
- Phase 5-6: 2-3 days (optimization)

## Status: READY TO EXECUTE
All migration tasks defined and ready for implementation.
