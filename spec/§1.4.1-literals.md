### Literals

In addition to paths, FHIRPath expressions may contain _literals_, _operators_, and _function invocations_. FHIRPath supports the following types of literals:

``` txt
Boolean: true, false
String: 'test string', 'urn:oid:3.4.5.6.7.8'
Integer: 0, 45
Long: 0L, 45L    // Long is defined as STU
Decimal: 0.0, 3.14159265
Date: @2015-02-04 (@ followed by ISO8601 compliant date)
DateTime: @2015-02-04T14:34:28+09:00 (@ followed by ISO8601 compliant date/time)
Time: @T14:34:28 (@ followed by ISO8601 compliant time beginning with T, no timezone offset)
Quantity: 10 'mg', 4 days
```

For each type of literal, FHIRPath defines a named system type to allow operations and functions to be defined, as well as an ultimate root type, `System.Any`. For example, the multiplication operator (`*`) is defined for the numeric types Integer and Decimal, as well as the Quantity type. See the discussion on [Models](#models) for a more detailed discussion of how these types are used within evaluation contexts.
