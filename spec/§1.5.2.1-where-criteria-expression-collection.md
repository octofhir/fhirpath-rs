#### where(criteria : expression) : collection

Returns a collection containing only those elements in the input collection for which the stated `criteria` expression evaluates to `true`. Elements for which the expression evaluates to `false` or empty (`{ }`) are not included in the result.

If the input collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is empty.

If the result of evaluating the condition is other than a single boolean value, the evaluation will end and signal an error to the calling environment, consistent with singleton evaluation of collections behavior.

The following example returns the list of `telecom` elements that have a `use` element with the value of `'official'`:

``` fhirpath
Patient.telecom.where(use = 'official')
```
