#### / (division)

Divides the left operand by the right operand (supported for Integer, Decimal, and Quantity). The result of a division is always Decimal, even if the inputs are both Integer. For integer division, use the `div` operator.

If an attempt is made to divide by zero, the result is empty.

For division involving quantities, the resulting quantity will have the appropriate unit:

``` fhirpath
12 'cm2' / 3 'cm' // 4.0 'cm'
12 / 0 // empty ({ })
```
