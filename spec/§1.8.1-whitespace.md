### Whitespace
FHIRPath defines _tab_ (`\t`), _space_ (`` ``), _line feed_ (`\n`) and _carriage return_ (`\r`) as _whitespace_, meaning they are only used to separate other tokens within the language. Any number of whitespace characters can appear, and the language does not use whitespace for anything other than delimiting tokens.
