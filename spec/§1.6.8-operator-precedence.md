### Operator precedence

Precedence of operations, in order from high to low:

``` txt
#01 . (path/function invocation)
#02 [] (indexer)
#03 unary + and -
#04: *, /, div, mod
#05: +, -, &
#06: is, as
#07: |
#08: >, <, >=, <=
#09: =, ~, !=, !~
#10: in, contains
#11: and
#12: xor, or
#13: implies
```

As customary, precedence may be established explicitly using parentheses (`( )`).

As an example, consider the following expression:

``` fhirpath
-7.combine(3)
```

Because the invocation operator (`.`) has a higher precedence than the unary negation (`-`), the unary negation will be applied to the result of the combine of 7 and 3, resulting in an error (because unary negation cannot be applied to a list):

``` fhirpath
-(7.combine(3)) // ERROR
```

Use parentheses to ensure the unary negation applies to the `7`:

``` fhirpath
(-7).combine(3) // { -7, 3 }
```
