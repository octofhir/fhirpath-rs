#### Quantity

The `Quantity` type represents quantities with a specified unit, where the `value` component is defined as a `Decimal`, and the `unit` element is represented as a `String` that is required to be either a valid Unified Code for Units of Measure [\[UCUM\]](#UCUM) unit or one of the calendar duration keywords, singular or plural.

The `Quantity` literal is a number (integer or decimal), followed by a (single-quoted) string representing a valid Unified Code for Units of Measure [\[UCUM\]](#UCUM) unit or calendar duration keyword. If the value literal is an Integer, it will be implicitly converted to a Decimal in the resulting Quantity value:

``` fhirpath
4.5 'mg'
100 '[degF]'
```

> Implementations must respect UCUM units, meaning that they must not ignore UCUM units in calculations involving quantities, including comparison, conversion, and arithmetic operations. For implementations that do not support unit conversion, this means that the calculation need only be supported if the units are the same value, case-sensitively.

> When using [\[UCUM\]](#UCUM) units within FHIRPath, implementations shall use case-sensitive comparisons.
>
> Implementations shall support comparison and arithmetic operations on quantities with units where the units are the same.
>
> Implementations should support other unit functionality as specified by UCUM, including unit conversion.
>
> Implementations that do not support complete UCUM functionality may return empty (`{ }`) for calculations involving quantities with units where the units are different.
