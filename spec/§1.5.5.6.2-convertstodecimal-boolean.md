##### convertsToDecimal() : Boolean

If the input collection contains a single item, this function will true if:

* the item is an Integer or Decimal
* the item is a String and is convertible to a Decimal
* the item is a Boolean

If the item is not one of the above types, or is not convertible to a Decimal (using the regex format `(\+|-)?\d+(\.\d+)?`), the result is false.

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.
