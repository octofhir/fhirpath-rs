#### is(type : _type specifier_)

The `is()` function is supported for backwards compatibility with previous implementations of FHIRPath. Just as with the `is` keyword, the `type` argument is an identifier that must resolve to the name of a type in a model. For implementations with compile-time typing, this requires special-case handling when processing the argument to treat it as a type specifier rather than an identifier expression:

``` fhirpath
Bundle.entry.resource.all($this.is(Observation) implies status = 'finished')
```

> **Note:** The `is()` function is defined for backwards compatibility only and may be deprecated in a future release.
