The functions in this section operate on collections with a single item. Unless otherwise noted, if there is more than one item, or the item is not compatible with the expected type, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.
{:.stu}

Note also that although all functions return collections, if a given function is defined to return a single element, the return type in the description of the function is simplified to just the type of the single element, rather than the list type.

The math functions in this section enable FHIRPath to be used not only for path selection, but for providing a platform-independent representation of calculation logic in artifacts such as questionnaires and documentation templates. For example:
{:.stu}

``` fhirpath
(%weight/(%height.power(2))).round(1)
```
{:.stu}

This example from a questionnaire calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the responses to the weight and height elements. For more information on the use of FHIRPath in questionnaires, see the [Structured Data Capture](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/) (SDC) implementation guide.
