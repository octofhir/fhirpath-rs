### Boolean logic
For all boolean operators, the collections passed as operands are first evaluated as Booleans (as described in [Singleton Evaluation of Collections](#singleton-evaluation-of-collections)). The operators then use three-valued logic to propagate empty operands.

> **Note:** To ensure that FHIRPath expressions can be freely rewritten by underlying implementations, there is no expectation that an implementation respect short-circuit evaluation. With regard to performance, implementations may use short-circuit evaluation to reduce computation, but authors should not rely on such behavior, and implementations must not change semantics with short-circuit evaluation. If short-circuit evaluation is needed to avoid effects (e.g. runtime exceptions), use the [`iif()`](#iif) function.
