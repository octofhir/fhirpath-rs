#### isDistinct() : Boolean

Returns `true` if all the items in the input collection are distinct. To determine whether two items are distinct, the [equals](#equals) (`=`) operator is used, as defined below.

Conceptually, this function is shorthand for a comparison of the `count()` of the input collection against the `count()` of the `distinct()` of the input collection:

``` fhirpath
X.count() = X.distinct().count()
```

This means that if the input collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is true.
