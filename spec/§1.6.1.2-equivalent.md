#### ~ (Equivalent)

Returns `true` if the collections are the same. In particular, comparing empty collections for equivalence `{ } ~ { }`{:.fhirpath} will result in `true`.

If both operands are collections with a single item, they must be of the same type (or implicitly convertible to the same type), and:

* For primitives
  * `String`: the strings must be the same, ignoring case and locale, and normalizing whitespace (see [String Equivalence](#string-equivalence) for more details).
  * `Integer`: exactly equal
  * `Decimal`: values must be equal, comparison is done on values rounded to the precision of the least precise operand. Trailing zeroes after the decimal are ignored in determining precision.
  * `Date`, `DateTime` and `Time`: values must be equal, except that if the input values have different levels of precision, the comparison returns `false`, not empty (`{ }`).
  * `Boolean`: the values must be the same
* For complex types, equivalence requires all child properties to be equivalent, recursively.

If both operands are collections with multiple items:

* Each item must be equivalent
* Comparison is not order dependent

Note that this implies that if the collections have a different number of items to compare, or if one input is a value and the other is empty (`{ }`), the result will be `false`.
