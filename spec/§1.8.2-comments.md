### Comments
FHIRPath defines two styles of comments, _single-line_, and _multi-line_. A single-line comment consists of two forward slashes, followed by any text up to the end of the line:

``` fhirpath
2 + 2 // This is a single-line comment
```

To begin a multi-line comment, the typical forward slash-asterisk token is used. The comment is closed with an asterisk-forward slash, and everything enclosed is ignored:

``` fhirpath
/*
This is a multi-line comment
Any text enclosed within is ignored
*/
```
