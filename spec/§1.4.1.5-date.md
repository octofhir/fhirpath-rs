#### Date

The `Date` type represents date and partial date values in the range @0001-01-01 to @9999-12-31 with a 1 day step size.

The `Date` literal is a subset of [\[ISO8601\]](#ISO8601):

* A date literal begins with an `@`
* It uses the format **YYYY-MM-DD** format, though month and day parts are optional, and a separator is required between provided components
* Week dates and ordinal dates are not allowed
* Years must be present (e.g. `@-10-20` is not a valid Date in FHIRPath)
* Months must be present if a day is present
* To specify a date and time together, see the description of `DateTime` below

The following examples illustrate the use of the `Date` literal:

``` fhirpath
@2014-01-25
@2014-01
@2014
```
