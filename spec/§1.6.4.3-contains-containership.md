#### contains (containership)
If the right operand is a collection with a single item, this operator returns true if the item is in the left operand using equality semantics. If the right-hand side of the operator is empty, the result is empty, if the left-hand side is empty, the result is false. This is the converse operation of in.

The following example returns true if the list of given names for the Patient has `'Joe'` in it:

``` fhirpath
Patient.name.given contains 'Joe'
```
