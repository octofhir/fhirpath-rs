#### defineVariable(name: String [, expr: expression])
> **Note:** The contents of this section are Standard for Trial Use (STU)
{: .stu-note }

Defines a variable named `name` that is accessible in subsequent expressions and has the value of `expr` if present, otherwise the value of the input collection. In either case the function does not change the input and the output is the same as the input collection.
{:.stu}

If the name already exists in the current expression scope, the evaluation will end and signal an error to the calling environment. Note that functions that take an `expression` as an argument establish a scope for the iteration variables ($this and $index). If a variable is defined within such an expression, it is only available within that expression scope.

Example:
{:.stu}
``` fhirpath
group.select(
  defineVariable('grp')
  .select(
    element.select(
      defineVariable('src')
      .target.select(
        %grp.source & '#' & %src.code
        & ' ' & equivalence & ' '
        & %grp.target & '#' & code
      )
    )
  )
)
```

> **Note:** this would be implemented using expression scoping on the variable stack and after expression completion the temporary variable would be popped off the stack.
