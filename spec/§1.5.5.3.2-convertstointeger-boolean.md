##### convertsToInteger() : Boolean

If the input collection contains a single item, this function will return true if:

* the item is an Integer
* the item is a String and is convertible to an Integer
* the item is a Boolean

If the item is not one of the above types, or the item is a String, but is not convertible to an Integer (using the regex format `(\+|-)?\d+`), the result is false.

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.
