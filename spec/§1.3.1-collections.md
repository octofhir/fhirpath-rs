### Collections

Collections are fundamental to FHIRPath, in that the result of every expression is a collection, even if that expression only results in a single element. This approach allows paths to be specified without having to care about the cardinality of any particular element, and is therefore ideally suited to graph traversal.

Within FHIRPath, a collection is:

* Ordered - The order of items in the collection is important and is preserved through operations as much as possible. Operators and functions that do not preserve order will note that in their documentation.
* Non-Unique - Duplicate elements are allowed within a collection. Some operations and functions, such as `distinct()` and the union operator `|` produce collections of unique elements, but in general, duplicate elements are allowed.
* Indexed - Each item in a collection can be addressed by its index, i.e. ordinal position within the collection (e.g. `a[2]`).
* Unless specified otherwise by the underlying Object Model, the first item in a collection has index 0. Note that if the underlying model specifies that a collection is 1-based (the only reasonable alternative to 0-based collections), _any collections generated from operations on the 1-based list are 0-based_.
* Countable - The number of items in a given collection can always be determined using the `count()` function

Note that the outcome of functions like `children()` and `descendants()` cannot be assumed to be in any meaningful order, and `first()`, `last()`, `tail()`, `skip()` and `take()` should not be used on collections derived from these paths. Note that some implementations may follow the logical order implied by the object model, and some may not, and some may be different depending on the underlying source. Implementations may decide to return an error if an attempt is made to perform an order-dependent operation on a list whose order is undefined.
