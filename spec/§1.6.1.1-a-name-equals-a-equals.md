#### <a name="equals"></a>= (Equals)

Returns `true` if the left collection is equal to the right collection:

As noted above, if either operand is an empty collection, the result is an empty collection. Otherwise:

If both operands are collections with a single item, they must be of the same type (or be implicitly convertible to the same type), and:

* For primitives:
  * `String`: comparison is based on Unicode values
  * `Integer`: values must be exactly equal
  * `Decimal`: values must be equal, trailing zeroes after the decimal are ignored
  * `Boolean`: values must be the same
  * `Date`: must be exactly the same
  * `DateTime`: must be exactly the same, respecting the timezone offset (though +00:00 = -00:00 = Z)
  * `Time`: must be exactly the same
* For complex types, equality requires all child properties to be equal, recursively.

If both operands are collections with multiple items:

* Each item must be equal
* Comparison is order dependent

Otherwise, equals returns `false`.

Note that this implies that if the collections have a different number of items to compare, the result will be `false`.

Typically, this operator is used with single fixed values as operands. This means that `Patient.telecom.system = 'phone'`{:.fhirpath} will result in an error if there is more than one `telecom` with a `use`. Typically, you'd want `Patient.telecom.where(system = 'phone')`{:.fhirpath}

If one or both of the operands is the empty collection, this operation returns an empty collection.
