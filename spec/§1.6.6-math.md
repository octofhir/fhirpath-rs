### Math

The math operators require each operand to be a single element. Both operands must be of the same type, or of compatible types according to the rules for implicit conversion. Each operator below specifies which types are supported.

If there is more than one item, or an incompatible item, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

As with the other operators, the math operators will return an empty collection if one or both of the operands are empty.

When operating on quantities, the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of `'cm'` and `'m'` can be compared, but units of `'cm2'` and  `'cm'` cannot. The unit of the result will be the most granular unit of either input. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in empty (`{ }`).

Implementations are not required to fully support operations on units, but they must at least respect units, recognizing when units differ.

Implementations that do support units shall do so as specified by [\[UCUM\]](#UCUM) as well as the calendar durations as defined in the toQuantity function.

Operations that cause arithmetic overflow or underflow will result in empty (`{ }`).
