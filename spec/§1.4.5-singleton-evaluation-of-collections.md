### Singleton Evaluation of Collections

In general, when a collection is passed as an argument to a function or operator that expects a single item as input, the collection is implicitly converted to a singleton as follows:

``` txt
IF the collection contains a single node AND the node's value can be implicitly converted to the expected input type THEN
  The collection evaluates to the value of that single node
ELSE IF the collection contains a single node AND the expected input type is Boolean THEN
  The collection evaluates to true
ELSE IF the collection is empty THEN
  The collection evaluates to an empty collection
ELSE
  The evaluation will end and signal an error to the calling environment
```

For example:

``` fhirpath
Patient.name.family + ', ' + Patient.name.given
```

If the `Patient` instance has a single `name`, and that name has a single `given`, then this will evaluate without any issues. However, if the `Patient` has multiple `name` elements, or the single name has multiple `given` elements, then it's ambiguous which of the elements should be used as the input to the `+` operator, and the result is an error.

As another example:

``` fhirpath
Patient.active and Patient.gender and Patient.telecom
```

Assuming the `Patient` instance has an `active` value of `true`, a `gender` of `female` and a single `telecom` element, this expression will result in true. However, consider a different instance of `Patient` that has an `active` value of `true`, a `gender` of `male`, and multiple `telecom` elements, then this expression will result in an error because of the multiple telecom elements.

Note that for repeating elements like `telecom` in the above example, the logic _looks_ like an existence check. To avoid confusion and reduce unintended errors, authors should use the explicit form of these checks when appropriate. For example, a more explicit rendering of the same logic that more clearly indicates the actual intent and avoids the run-time error is:

``` fhirpath
Patient.active and Patient.gender and Patient.telecom.count() = 1
```
