#### replaceMatches(regex : String, substitution: String) : String

Matches the input using the regular expression in `regex` and replaces each match with the `substitution` string. The substitution may refer to identified match groups in the regular expression.

If the input collection, `regex`, or `substitution` are empty, the result is empty (`{ }`).

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

This example of `replaceMatches()` will convert a string with a date formatted as MM/dd/yy to dd-MM-yy:

``` fhirpath
'11/30/1972'.replaceMatches('\\b(?<month>\\d{1,2})/(?<day>\\d{1,2})/(?<year>\\d{2,4})\\b',
       '${day}-${month}-${year}')
```

> **Note:** Platforms will typically use native regular expression implementations. These are typically fairly similar, but there will always be small differences. As such, FHIRPath does not prescribe a particular dialect, but recommends the use of the [\[PCRE\]](#PCRE) flavor as the dialect most likely to be broadly supported and understood.
