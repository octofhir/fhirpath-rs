### Null and empty

There is no literal representation for _null_ in FHIRPath. This means that when, in an underlying data object (i.e. they physical data on which the implementation is operating) a member is null or missing, there will simply be no corresponding node for that member in the tree, e.g. `Patient.name`{:.fhirpath} will return an empty collection (not null) if there are no name elements in the instance.

In expressions, the empty collection is represented as `{ }`.
