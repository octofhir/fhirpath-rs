### Function Invocations

Finally, FHIRPath supports the notion of functions, which operate on a collection of values (referred to as the _input collection_), optionally taking arguments, and return another collection (referred to as the _output collection_). For example:

``` fhirpath
name.given.substring(0,4)
identifier.where(use = 'official')
```

Since all functions work on input collections, constants will first be converted to a collection when functions are invoked on constants:

``` fhirpath
(4+5).count()
```

will return `1`, since the input collection is implicitly a collection with one constant number `9`.

In general, functions in FHIRPath operate on collections and return new collections. This property, combined with the syntactic style of _dot invocation_ enables functions to be chained together, creating a _fluent_-style syntax:

``` fhirpath
Patient.telecom.where(use = 'official').union(Patient.contact.telecom.where(use = 'official')).exists().not()
```
