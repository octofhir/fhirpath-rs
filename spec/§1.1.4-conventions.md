### Conventions

Throughout this documentation, `monospace font` is used to delineate expressions of FHIRPath.

Optional parameters to functions are enclosed in square brackets in the definition of a function. Note that the brackets are only used to indicate optionality in the signature, they are not part of the actual syntax of FHIRPath.

All operations and functions return a collection, but if the operation or function will always produce a collection containing a single item of a predefined type, the description of the operation or function will specify its output type explicitly, instead of just stating `collection`, e.g. `all(...) : Boolean`

Throughout this specification, formatting patterns for Date, Time, and DateTime values are described using an informal description with the following markers:

* **YYYY** - A full four digit year (0001..9999), padded with leading zeroes if necessary
* **MM** - A full two digit month value (01..12), padded with leading zeroes if necessary
* **DD** - A full two digit day value (01..31), padded with leading zeroes if necessary
* **hh** - A full two digit hour value (00..24), padded with leading zeroes if necessary
* **mm** - A full two digit minute value (00..59), padded with leading zeroes if necessary
* **ss** - A full two digit second value (00..59), padded with leading zeroes if necessary
* **fff** - A fractional millisecond value (0..999)

These formatting patterns are set in **bold** to distinguish them typographically from literals or code and to make clear that they are not intended to be formally interpreted as regex patterns.
