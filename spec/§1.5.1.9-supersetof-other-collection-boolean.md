#### supersetOf(other : collection) : Boolean

Returns `true` if all items in the collection passed as the `other` argument are members of the input collection. Membership is determined using the [equals](#equals) (`=`) operation.

Conceptually, this function is evaluated by testing each element in the `other` collection for membership in the input collection, with a default of `true`. This means that if the `other` collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is `true`, otherwise if the input collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is `false`.

The following example returns true if the tags defined in any contained resource are a superset of the tags defined in the MedicationRequest resource:

``` fhirpath
MedicationRequest.contained.meta.tag.supersetOf(MedicationRequest.meta.tag)
```
