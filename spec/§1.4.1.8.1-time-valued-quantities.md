##### Time-valued Quantities

For time-valued quantities, in addition to the definite duration UCUM units, FHIRPath defines calendar duration keywords for calendar duration units:


| Calendar Duration | Unit Representation | Relationship to Definite Duration UCUM Unit |
| - | - | - |
| `year`/`years` | `'year'` | `~ 1 'a'` |
| `month`/`months` | `'month'` | `~ 1 'mo'` |
| `week`/`weeks` | `'week'` | `~ 1 'wk'` |
| `day`/`days` | `'day'` | `~ 1 'd'` |
| `hour`/`hours` | `'hour'` | `~ 1 'h'` |
| `minute`/`minutes` | `'minute'` | `~ 1 'min'` |
| `second`/`seconds` | `'second'` | `= 1 's'` |
| `millisecond`/`milliseconds` | `'millisecond'` | `= 1 'ms'` |
{: .grid}

For example, the following quantities are _calendar duration_ quantities:

``` fhirpath
1 year
4 days
```

Whereas the following quantities are _definite duration_ quantities:

``` fhirpath
1 'a'
4 'd'
```

The table above defines the equality/equivalence relationship between calendar and definite duration quantities. For example, `1 year` is not equal to `1 'a'`, but it is equivalent to `1 'a'`. See [Date/Time Arithmetic](#datetime-arithmetic) for more information on using time-valued quantities in FHIRPath.
