#### Current date and time functions

The following functions return the current date and time. The timestamp that these functions use is an implementation decision, and implementations should consider providing options appropriate for their environment. In the simplest case, the local server time is used as the timestamp for these function.

To ensure deterministic evaluation, these operators should return the same value regardless of how many times they are evaluated within any given expression (i.e. now() should always return the same DateTime in a given expression, timeOfDay() should always return the same Time in a given expression, and today() should always return the same Date in a given expression.)
