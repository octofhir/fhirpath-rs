#### trace(name : String [, projection: Expression]) : collection

Adds a String representation of the input collection to the diagnostic log, using the `name` argument as the name in the log. This log should be made available to the user in some appropriate fashion. Does not change the input, so returns the input collection as output.

If the `projection` argument is used, the trace would log the result of evaluating the project expression on the input, but still return the input to the trace function unchanged.

``` fhirpath
contained.where(criteria).trace('unmatched', id).empty()
```

The above example traces only the id elements of the result of the where.
