#### Time

The `Time` type represents time-of-day and partial time-of-day values in the range @T00:00:00.000 to @T23:59:59.999 with a step size of 1 millisecond. This range is defined based on a survey of time implementations and is based on the most useful lowest common denominator. Implementations can provide support for higher precision, but must provide at least the range and precision defined here. Time values in FHIRPath do not have a timezone or timezone offset.

The `Time` literal uses a subset of [\[ISO8601\]](#ISO8601):

* A time begins with a `@T`
* It uses the **Thh:mm:ss.fff** format

The following examples illustrate the use of the `Time` literal:

``` fhirpath
@T12:00
@T14:30:14.559
```
