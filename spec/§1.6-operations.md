## Operations

Operators are allowed to be used between any kind of path expressions (e.g. expr op expr). Like functions, operators will generally propagate an empty collection in any of their operands. This is true even when comparing two empty collections using the equality operators, e.g.

``` fhirpath
{} = {}
true > {}
{} != 'dummy'
```

all result in `{}`.
