##### toQuantity([unit : String]) : Quantity

If the input collection contains a single item, this function will return a single quantity if:

* the item is an Integer, or Decimal, where the resulting quantity will have the default unit (`'1'`)
* the item is a Quantity
* the item is a String and is convertible to a Quantity
* the item is a Boolean, where `true` results in the quantity `1.0 '1'`, and `false` results in the quantity `0.0 '1'`

If the item is not one of the above types, the result is empty.

If the item is a String, but the string is not convertible to a Quantity using the following regex format:

``` regex
(?'value'(\+|-)?\d+(\.\d+)?)\s*('(?'unit'[^']+)'|(?'time'[a-zA-Z]+))?
```

then the result is empty. For example, the following are valid quantity strings:

``` fhirpath
'4 days'
'10 \'mg[Hg]\''
```

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.

If the `unit` argument is provided, it must be the string representation of a UCUM code (or a FHIRPath calendar duration keyword), and is used to determine whether the input quantity can be converted to the given unit, according to the unit conversion rules specified by UCUM. If the input quantity can be converted, the result is the converted quantity, otherwise, the result is empty.

For calendar durations, FHIRPath defines the following conversion factors:

| Calendar duration | Conversion factor |
| - | -|
| `1 year` | `12 months` or `365 days` |
| `1 month` | `30 days` |
| `1 day` | `24 hours` |
| `1 hour` | `60 minutes` |
| `1 minute` | `60 seconds` |
| `1 second` | `1 's'` |
{: .grid}

Note that calendar duration conversion factors are only used when time-valued quantities appear in unanchored calculations. See [Date/Time Arithmetic](#datetime-arithmetic) for more information on using time-valued quantities in FHIRPath.

If `q` is a Quantity of `'kg'` and one wants to convert to a Quantity in `'g'` (grams):
``` fhirpath
q.toQuantity('g') // changes the value and units in the quantity according to UCUM conversion rules
```

> Implementations are not required to support a complete UCUM implementation, and may return empty (`{ }`) when the `unit` argument is used and it is different than the input quantity unit.
