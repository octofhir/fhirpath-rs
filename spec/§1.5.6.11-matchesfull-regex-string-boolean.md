#### matchesFull(regex : String) : Boolean

> **Note:** The contents of this section are Standard for Trial Use (STU)
{: .stu-note }

Returns `true` when the value completely matches the given regular expression (implying that the start/end of line markers `^`, `$` are always surrounding the regex expression provided).
{:.stu}
Regular expressions should function consistently, regardless of any culture- and locale-specific settings in the environment, should be case-sensitive, use 'single line' mode and allow Unicode characters.
{:.stu}

If the input collection or `regex` are empty, the result is empty (`{ }`).
{:.stu}

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

``` fhirpath
'http://fhir.org/guides/cqf/common/Library/FHIR-ModelInfo|4.0.1'.matchesFull('Library') // returns false
'N8000123123'.matchesFull('N[0-9]{8}') // returns false as the string is not an 8 char number (it has 10)
'N8000123123'.matchesFull('N[0-9]{10}') // returns true as the string has an 10 number sequence in it starting with `N`
