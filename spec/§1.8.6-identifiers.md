### Identifiers
Identifiers are used as labels to allow expressions to reference elements such as model types and properties. FHIRPath supports two types of identifiers, _simple_ and _delimited_.

A simple identifier is any alphabetical character or an underscore, followed by any number of alpha-numeric characters or underscores. For example, the following are all valid simple identifiers:

``` fhirpath
Patient
_id
valueDateTime
_1234
```

A delimited identifier is any sequence of characters enclosed in backticks (`` ` ``):

``` fhirpath
`QI-Core Patient`
`US-Core Diagnostic Request`
`us-zip`
```

The use of backticks allows identifiers to contains spaces, commas, and other characters that would not be allowed within simple identifiers. This allows identifiers to be more descriptive, and also enables expressions to reference models that have property or type names that are not valid simple identifiers.

FHIRPath [escape sequences](#string) for strings also work for delimited identifiers.

When resolving an identifier that is also the root of a FHIRPath expression, it is resolved as a type name first, and if it resolves to a type, it must resolve to the type of the context (or a supertype). Otherwise, it is resolved as a path on the context. If the identifier cannot be resolved, the evaluation will end and signal an error to the calling environment.
