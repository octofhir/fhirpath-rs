#### select(projection: expression) : collection

Evaluates the `projection` expression for each item in the input collection. The result of each evaluation is added to the output collection. If the evaluation results in a collection with multiple items, all items are added to the output collection (collections resulting from evaluation of `projection` are _flattened_). This means that if the evaluation for an element results in the empty collection (`{ }`), no element is added to the result, and that if the input collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is empty as well.

``` fhirpath
Bundle.entry.select(resource as Patient)
```

This example results in a collection with only the patient resources from the bundle.

``` fhirpath
Bundle.entry.select((resource as Patient).telecom.where(system = 'phone'))
```

This example results in a collection with all the telecom elements with system of `phone` for all the patients in the bundle.

``` fhirpath
Patient.name.where(use = 'usual').select(given.first() + ' ' + family)
```

This example returns a collection containing, for each "usual" name for the Patient, the concatenation of the first given and family names.
