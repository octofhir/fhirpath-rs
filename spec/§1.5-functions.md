## Functions

Functions are distinguished from path navigation names by the fact that they are followed by a `()` with zero or more arguments. Throughout this specification, the word _parameter_ is used to refer to the definition of a parameter as part of the function definition, while the word _argument_ is used to refer to the values passed as part of a function invocation. With a few minor exceptions (e.g. [current date and time functions](#current-date-and-time-functions)), functions in FHIRPath operate on a collection of values (referred to as the _input collection_) and produce another collection as output (referred to as the _output collection_). However, for many functions, passing an input collection with more than one item is defined as an error condition. Each function definition should define its behavior for input collections of any cardinality (0, 1, or many).

Correspondingly, arguments to the functions can be any FHIRPath expression, though functions taking a single item as input require these expressions to evaluate to a collection containing a single item of a specific type. This approach allows functions to be chained, successively operating on the results of the previous function in order to produce the desired final result.

The following sections describe the functions supported in FHIRPath, detailing the expected types of parameters and type of collection returned by the function:

* If the function expects the argument passed to a parameter to be a single value (e.g. `startsWith(prefix: String)`) and it is passed an argument that evaluates to a collection with multiple items, or to a collection with an item that is not of the required type (or cannot be converted to the required type), the evaluation of the expression will end and an error will be signaled to the calling environment.
* If the function takes an `expression` as a parameter, the function will evaluate the expression passed for the parameter with respect to each of the items in the input collection. These expressions may refer to the special `$this` and `$index` elements, which represent the item from the input collection currently under evaluation, and its index in the collection, respectively. For example, in `name.given.where($this > 'ba' and $this < 'bc')`{:.fhirpath} the `where()` function will iterate over each item in the input collection (elements named `given`) and `$this` will be set to each item when the expression passed to `where()` is evaluated.

For the [aggregate](#aggregates) function, expressions may also refer to the special `$total` element, representing the result of the aggregation.

Note that the bracket notation in function signatures indicates optional parameters.

Note also that although all functions return collections, if a given function is defined to return a single element, the return type is simplified to just the type of the single element, rather than the list type.
