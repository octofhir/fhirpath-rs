### Paths and polymorphic items

In the underlying representation of data, nodes may be typed and represent polymorphic items. Paths may either ignore the type of a node, and continue along the path or may be explicit about the expected node and filter the set of nodes by type before navigating down child nodes:

``` fhirpath
Observation.value.unit // all kinds of value
Observation.value.ofType(Quantity).unit // only values that are of type Quantity
```

The `is` operator can be used to determine whether or not a given value is of a given type:

``` fhirpath
Observation.value is Quantity // returns true if the value is of type Quantity
```

The `as` operator can be used to treat a value as a specific type:

``` fhirpath
Observation.value as Quantity // returns value as a Quantity if it is of type Quantity, and an empty result otherwise
```

The list of available types that can be passed as an argument to the `ofType()` function and `is` and `as` operators is determined by the underlying object model. Within FHIRPath, they are just identifiers, either delimited or simple.
