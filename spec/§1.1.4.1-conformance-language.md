#### Conformance Language

This specification uses the conformance verbs SHALL, MUST, SHOULD, and MAY as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). Unlike RFC 2119, however, this specification allows that different applications might not be able to interoperate because of how they use optional features. In particular:

* SHALL/MUST: An absolute requirement for all implementations
* SHALL/MUST NOT: An absolute prohibition against inclusion for all implementations
* SHOULD/SHOULD NOT: A best practice or recommendation to be considered by implementers within the context of their particular implementation; there may be valid reasons to ignore an item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course
* MAY: This is truly optional language for an implementation; can be included or omitted as the implementer decides with no implications.
