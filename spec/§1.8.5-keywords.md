### Keywords
Keywords are tokens that are recognized by the parser and used to build the various language constructs. FHIRPath defines the following keywords:

|`$index` |`div` |`milliseconds` |`true`
|=|=|=|=|
|`$this` |`false` |`minute` |`week`
|`$total` |`hour` |`minutes` |`weeks`
|`and` |`hours` |`mod` |`xor`
|`as` |`implies` |`month` |`year`
|`contains` |`in` |`months` |`years`
|`day` |`is` |`or` |`second`
|`days` |`millisecond` |`seconds` |
{:.grid}

In general, keywords within FHIRPath are also considered _reserved_ words, meaning that it is illegal to use them as identifiers. FHIRPath keywords are reserved words, with the exception of the following keywords that may also be used as identifiers:

|`as` |`contains` |
|`is` | |
{:.grid}

If necessary, identifiers that clash with a reserved word can be delimited using a backtick (`` ` ``):

``` fhirpath
Patient.text.`div`.empty()
```

The `div` element of the `Patient.text` must be offset with backticks (`` ` ``) because `div` is both a keyword and a reserved word.
