### String Manipulation

The functions in this section operate on collections with a single item. If there is more than one item, or an item that is not a String, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

To use these functions over a collection with multiple items, one may use filters like `where()` and `select()`:

``` fhirpath
Patient.name.given.select(substring(0))
```

This example returns a collection containing the first character of all the given names for a patient.
