### Usage

In Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ([FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir)), FHIRPath is used within the specification to provide formal definitions for conditions such as validation invariants, search parameter paths, etc. Within Clinical Quality Language ([CQL](http://cql.hl7.org)), FHIRPath is used to simplify graph-traversal for hierarchical information models.

In both FHIR and CQL, the model independence of FHIRPath means that expressions can be written that deal with the contents of the resources and data types as described in the Logical views, or the UML diagrams, rather than against the physical representation of those resources. JSON and XML specific features are not visible to the FHIRPath language (such as comments and the split representation of primitives (i.e. `value[x]`)).

The expressions can in theory be converted to equivalent expressions in XPath, OCL, or another similarly expressive language.

FHIRPath can be used against many other graphs as well. For example, [Use of FHIRPath on HL7 Version 2 messages](#hl7v2) describes how FHIRPath is used in HL7 V2.
