If the left operand is a collection with a single item, this operator returns true if the item is in the right operand using equality semantics. If the left-hand side of the operator is empty, the result is empty, if the right-hand side is empty, the result is false. If the left operand has multiple items, an exception is thrown.

The following example returns true if `'Joe'` is in the list of given names for the Patient:

``` fhirpath
'Joe' in Patient.name.given
```
