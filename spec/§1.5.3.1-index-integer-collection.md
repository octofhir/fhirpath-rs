#### [ index : Integer ] : collection

The indexer operation returns a collection with only the `index`-th item (0-based index). If the input collection is empty (`{ }`), or the index lies outside the boundaries of the input collection, an empty collection is returned.

> **Note:** Unless specified otherwise by the underlying Object Model, the first item in a collection has index 0. Note that if the underlying model specifies that a collection is 1-based (the only reasonable alternative to 0-based collections), _any collections generated from operations on the 1-based list are 0-based_.

The following example returns the element in the `name` collection of the Patient with index 0:

``` fhirpath
Patient.name[0]
```
