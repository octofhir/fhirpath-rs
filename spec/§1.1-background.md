## Background

In Information Systems in general, and Healthcare Information Systems in particular, the need for formal representation of logic is both pervasive and critical. From low-level technical specifications, through intermediate logical architectures, up to the high-level conceptual descriptions of requirements and behavior, the ability to formally represent knowledge in terms of expressions and information models is essential to the specification and implementation of these systems.
