##### toDateTime() : DateTime

If the input collection contains a single item, this function will return a single datetime if:

* the item is a DateTime
* the item is a Date, in which case the result is a DateTime with the year, month, and day of the Date, and the time components empty (not set to zero)
* the item is a String and is convertible to a DateTime

If the item is not one of the above types, the result is empty.

If the item is a String, but the string is not convertible to a DateTime (using the format **YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.fff(+\|-)hh:mm**), the result is empty.

If the item contains a partial datetime (e.g. `'2012-01-01T10:00'`), the result is a partial datetime.

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.
