#### DateTime

The `DateTime` type represents date/time and partial date/time values in the range `@0001-01-01T00:00:00.000 to @9999-12-31T23:59:59.999` with a 1 millisecond step size. This range is defined based on a survey of datetime implementations and is based on the most useful lowest common denominator. Implementations can provide support for larger ranges and higher precision, but must provide at least the range and precision defined here.

The `DateTime` literal combines the `Date` and `Time` literals and is a subset of [\[ISO8601\]](#ISO8601):

* A datetime literal begins with an `@`
* It uses the **YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.fff(+\|-)hh:mm** format
* Timezone offset is optional, but if present the notation **(+\|-)hh:mm** is used (so must include both minutes and hours)
* **Z** is allowed as a synonym for the zero (+00:00) UTC offset.
* A `T` can be used at the end of any date (year, year-month, or year-month-day) to indicate a partial DateTime.

The following example illustrates the use of the `DateTime` literal:

``` fhirpath
@2014-01-25T14:30:14.559
@2014-01-25T14:30:14.559Z // A date time with UTC timezone offset
@2014-01-25T14:30 // A partial DateTime with year, month, day, hour, and minute
@2014-03-25T // A partial DateTime with year, month, and day
@2014-01T // A partial DateTime with year and month
@2014T // A partial DateTime with only the year
```

The suffix `T` is allowed after a year, year-month, or year-month-day literal because without it, there would be no way to specify a partial DateTime with only a year, month, or day; the literal would always result in a Date value.
