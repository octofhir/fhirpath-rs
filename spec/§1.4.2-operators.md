### Operators

Expressions can also contain _operators_, like those for mathematical operations and boolean logic:

``` fhirpath
Appointment.minutesDuration / 60 > 5
MedicationAdministration.wasNotGiven implies MedicationAdministration.reasonNotGiven.exists()
name.given | name.family // union of given and family names
'sir ' + name.given
```

Operators available in FHIRPath are covered in detail in the [Operations](#operations) section.
