### Requirements

Of particular importance is the ability to easily and precisely express conditions of basic logic, such as those found in requirements constraints (e.g. Patients must have a name), decision support (e.g. if the patient has diabetes and has not had a recent comprehensive foot exam), cohort definitions (e.g. All male patients aged 60-75), protocol descriptions (e.g. if the specimen has tested positive for the presence of sodium), and numerous other environments.

Precisely because the need for such expressions is so pervasive, there is no shortage of existing languages for representing them. However, these languages tend to be tightly coupled to the data structures, and even the information models on which they operate, XPath being a typical example. To ensure that the knowledge captured by the representation of these expressions can survive technological drift, a representation that can be used independent of any underlying physical implementation is required.

Languages meeting these additional requirements also exist, such as Object Constraint Language (OCL), Java, JavaScript, C#, and others. However, these languages are both tightly coupled to the platforms in which they operate, and, because they are general-purpose development languages, come with much heavier tooling and technology dependencies than is warranted or desirable. Even constraining one of these grammars would be insufficient, resulting in the need to extend, defeating the purpose of basing it on an existing language in the first place.

Given these constraints, and the lack of a specific language that meets all of these requirements, there is a need for a simple, lightweight, platform- and structure-independent graph traversal language. FHIRPath meets these requirements, and can be used within various environments to provide for simple but effective formal representation of expressions.
