### Date/Time Arithmetic

Date and time arithmetic operators are used to add time-valued quantities to date/time values. The left operand must be a `Date`, `DateTime`, or `Time` value, and the right operand must be a `Quantity` with a time-valued unit:

* `year`, `years`
* `month`, `months`
* `week`, `weeks`
* `day`, `days`
* `hour`, `hours`
* `minute`, `minutes`
* `second`, `seconds`, or `'s'`
* `millisecond`, `milliseconds`, or `'ms'`

To avoid the potential confusion of calendar-based date/time arithmetic with definite duration date/time arithmetic, FHIRPath defines definite-duration date/time arithmetic for seconds and below, and calendar-based date/time arithmetic for seconds and above. At the second, calendar-based and definite-duration-based date/time arithmetic are identical. If a definite-quantity duration above seconds appears in a date/time arithmetic calculation, the evaluation will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

Within FHIRPath, calculations involving date/times and calendar durations shall use calendar semantics as specified in [\[ISO8601\]](#ISO8601). Specifically:

|year |The year, positive or negative, is added to the year component of the date or time value. If the resulting year is out of range, an error is thrown. If the month and day of the date or time value is not a valid date in the resulting year, the last day of the calendar month is used. |
| = |
|month |The month, positive or negative is divided by 12, and the integer portion of the result is added to the year component. The remaining portion of months is added to the month component. If the resulting date is not a valid date in the resulting year, the last day of the resulting calendar month is used.|
|week |The week, positive or negative, is multiplied by 7, and the resulting value is added to the day component, respecting calendar month and calendar year lengths.|
|day |The day, positive or negative, is added to the day component, respecting calendar month and calendar year lengths.|
|hour |The hours, positive or negative, are added to the hour component, with each 24 hour block counting as a calendar day, and respecting calendar month and calendar year lengths.|
|minute |The minutes, positive or negative, are added to the minute component, with each 60 minute block counting as an hour, and respecting calendar month and calendar year lengths.|
|second |The seconds, positive or negative, are added to the second component, with each 60 second block counting as a minute, and respecting calendar month and calendar year lengths.|
|millisecond |The milliseconds, positive or negative, are added to the millisecond component, with each 1000 millisecond block counting as a second, and respecting calendar month and calendar year lengths.|

If there is more than one item, or an item of an incompatible type, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If either or both arguments are empty (`{ }`), the result is empty (`{ }`).
