#### + (addition)

Returns the value of the given `Date`, `DateTime`, or `Time`, incremented by the time-valued quantity, respecting variable length periods for calendar years and months.

For `Date` values, the quantity unit must be one of: `years`, `months`, `weeks`, or `days`

For `DateTime` values, the quantity unit must be one of: `years`, `months`, `weeks`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, or `milliseconds` (or an equivalent unit), or the evaluation will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

For `Time` values, the quantity unit must be one of: `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, or `milliseconds` (or an equivalent unit), or the evaluation will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

For precisions above `seconds`, the decimal portion of the time-valued quantity is ignored, since date/time arithmetic above seconds is performed with calendar duration semantics.

For partial date/time values where the time-valued quantity is more precise than the partial date/time, the operation is performed by converting the time-valued quantity to the highest precision in the partial (removing any decimal value off) and then adding to the date/time value. For example:

``` fhirpath
@2014 + 24 months
@2019-03-01 + 24 months // @2021-03-01
```

The first example above will evaluate to the value `@2016` even though the date/time value is not specified to the level of precision of the time-valued quantity. The second example will evaluate to `@2021-03-01`.

``` fhirpath
@2014 + 23 months
@2016 + 365 days
```

The first example above returns @2015, because 23 months only constitutes one year. The second example returns 2017 because even though 2016 is a leap-year, the time-valued quantity (`365 days`) is converted to `1 year`, a standard calendar year of 365 days.

Calculations involving weeks are equivalent to multiplying the number of weeks by 7 and performing the calculation for the resulting number of days.
