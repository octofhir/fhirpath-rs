## Expressions

FHIRPath expressions can consist of _paths_, _literals_, _operators_, and _function invocations_, and these elements can be chained together, so that the output of one operation or function is the input to the next. This is the core of the _fluent_ [\[Fluent\]](#fluent) syntactic style and allows complex paths and expressions to be built up from simpler components.
