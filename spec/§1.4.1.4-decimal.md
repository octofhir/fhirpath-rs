#### Decimal

The `Decimal` type represents real values in the range (-10<sup>28</sup>+1)/10<sup>8</sup> to (10<sup>28</sup>-1)/10<sup>8</sup> with a step size of 10<sup>-8</sup>. This range is defined based on a survey of decimal-value implementations and is based on the most useful lowest common denominator. Implementations can provide support for larger decimals and higher precision, but must provide at least the range and precision defined here. In addition, implementations should use [fixed-precision decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic) formats to ensure that decimal values are accurately represented.

Decimal literals cannot use exponential notation. There is enough additional complexity associated with enabling exponential notation that this is outside the scope of what FHIRPath is intended to support (namely graph traversal).
