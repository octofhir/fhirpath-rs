##### Quantity Equivalence

When comparing quantities for equivalence, the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of `'cm'` and `'m'` can be compared, but units of `'cm2'` and `'cm'` cannot. The comparison will be made using the most granular unit of either input. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in `false`.

For time-valued quantities, calendar durations and definite quantity durations are considered equivalent:

``` fhirpath
1 year ~ 1 'a' // true
1 second ~ 1 's' // true
```

Implementations are not required to fully support operations on units, but they must at least respect units, recognizing when units differ.

Implementations that do support units shall do so as specified by [\[UCUM\]](#UCUM) as well as the calendar durations as defined in the toQuantity function.
