### Models

Because FHIRPath is defined to work in multiple contexts, each context provides the definition for the structures available in that context. These structures are the *model* available for FHIRPath expressions. For example, within FHIR, the FHIR data types and resources are the model. To prevent namespace clashes, the type names within each model are prefixed (or namespaced) with the name of the model. For example, the fully qualified name of the Patient resource in FHIR is `FHIR.Patient`. The system types defined within FHIRPath directly are prefixed with the namespace `System`.

To allow type names to be referenced in expressions such as the `is` and `as` operators, the language includes a _type specifier_, an optionally qualified identifier that must resolve to the name of a model type.

When resolving a type name, the context-specific model is searched first. If no match is found, the `System` model (containing only the built-in types defined in the [Literals](#literals) section) is searched.

When resolving an identifier that is also the root of a FHIRPath expression, it is resolved as a type name first, and if it resolves to a type, it must resolve to the type of the context (or a supertype). Otherwise, it is resolved as a path on the context.
