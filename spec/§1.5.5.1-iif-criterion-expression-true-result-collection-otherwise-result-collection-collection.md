#### iif(criterion: expression, true-result: collection [, otherwise-result: collection]) : collection

The `iif` function in FHIRPath is an _immediate if_, also known as a conditional operator (such as C's `? :` operator).

The `criterion` expression is expected to evaluate to a Boolean.

If `criterion` is true, the function returns the value of the `true-result` argument.

If `criterion` is `false` or an empty collection, the function returns `otherwise-result`, unless the optional `otherwise-result` is not given, in which case the function returns an empty collection.

Note that short-circuit behavior is expected in this function. In other words, `true-result` should only be evaluated if the `criterion` evaluates to true, and `otherwise-result` should only be evaluated otherwise. For implementations, this means delaying evaluation of the arguments.
