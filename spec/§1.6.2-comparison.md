### Comparison

* The comparison operators are defined for strings, integers, decimals, quantities, dates, datetimes and times.
* If one or both of the arguments is an empty collection, a comparison operator will return an empty collection.
* Both arguments must be collections with single values, and the evaluator will throw an error if either collection has more than one item.
* Both arguments must be of the same type (or implicitly convertible to the same type), and the evaluator will throw an error if the types differ.
* When comparing integers and decimals, the integer will be converted to a decimal to make comparison possible.
* String ordering is strictly lexical and is based on the Unicode value of the individual characters.

When comparing quantities, the dimensions of each quantity must be the same, but not necessarily the unit. For example, units of `'cm'` and `'m'` can be compared, but units of `'cm2'` and `'cm'` cannot. The comparison will be made using the most granular unit of either input. Attempting to operate on quantities with invalid units will result in empty (`{ }`).

For time-valued quantities, note that calendar durations and definite quantity durations above days (and weeks) are considered un-comparable:

``` fhirpath
1 year > 1 `a` // { } (empty)
10 seconds > 1 's' // true
```

Implementations are not required to fully support operations on units, but they must at least respect units, recognizing when units differ.

Implementations that do support units shall do so as specified by [\[UCUM\]](#UCUM) as well as the calendar durations as defined in the toQuantity function.

For partial Date, DateTime, and Time values, the comparison is performed by comparing the values at each precision, beginning with years, and proceeding to the finest precision specified in either input, and respecting timezone offsets. If one value is specified to a different level of precision than the other, the result is empty (`{ }`) to indicate that the result of the comparison is unknown. As with equality and equivalence, the second and millisecond precisions are considered a single precision using a decimal, with decimal comparison semantics.

See the [Equals](#equals) operator for discussion on respecting timezone offsets in comparison operations.
