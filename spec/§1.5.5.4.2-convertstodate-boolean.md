##### convertsToDate() : Boolean

If the input collection contains a single item, this function will return true if:

* the item is a Date
* the item is a DateTime
* the item is a String and is convertible to a Date

If the item is not one of the above types, or is not convertible to a Date (using the format **YYYY-MM-DD**), the result is false.

If the item contains a partial date (e.g. `'2012-01'`), the result is a partial date.

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.
