### aggregate(aggregator : expression [, init : value]) : value
{:.stu}
Performs general-purpose aggregation by evaluating the aggregator expression for each element of the input collection. Within this expression, the standard iteration variables of `$this` and `$index` can be accessed, but also a `$total` aggregation variable.
{:.stu}

The value of the `$total` variable is set to `init`, or empty (`{ }`) if no `init` value is supplied, and is set to the result of the aggregator expression after every iteration.<br/>
The result of the aggregate function is the value of `$total` after the last iteration.
{:.stu}

Using this function, sum can be expressed as:
{:.stu}

``` fhirpath
value.aggregate($this + $total, 0)
```
{:.stu}

Min can be expressed as:
{:.stu}

``` fhirpath
value.aggregate(iif($total.empty(), $this, iif($this < $total, $this, $total)))
```
{:.stu}

and average would be expressed as:
{:.stu}

``` fhirpath
value.aggregate($total + $this, 0) / value.count()
```
{:.stu}
