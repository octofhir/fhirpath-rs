* Fluent: FHIRPath has a syntax based on the [Fluent Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) pattern
* Collection-centric: FHIRPath deals with all values as collections, allowing it to easily deal with information models with repeating elements.
* Platform-independent: FHIRPath is a conceptual and logical specification that can be implemented in any platform.
* Model-independent: FHIRPath deals with data as an abstract model, allowing it to be used with any information model.
