#### ofType(type : _type specifier_) : collection

Returns a collection that contains all items in the input collection that are of the given type or a subclass thereof. If the input collection is empty (`{ }`), the result is empty. The `type` argument is an identifier that must resolve to the name of a type in a model. For implementations with compile-time typing, this requires special-case handling when processing the argument to treat it as type specifier rather than an identifier expression:

``` fhirpath
Bundle.entry.resource.ofType(Patient)
```

In the above example, the symbol `Patient` must be treated as a type identifier rather than a reference to a Patient in context.
