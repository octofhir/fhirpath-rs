##### toBoolean() : Boolean

If the input collection contains a single item, this function will return a single boolean if:

* the item is a Boolean
* the item is an Integer and is equal to one of the possible integer representations of Boolean values
* the item is a Decimal that is equal to one of the possible decimal representations of Boolean values
* the item is a String that is equal to one of the possible string representations of Boolean values

If the item is not one the above types, or the item is a String, Integer, or Decimal, but is not equal to one of the possible values convertible to a Boolean, the result is empty.

The following table describes the possible values convertible to an Boolean:

| Type | Representation | Result |
| -| - | - |
| **String** | `'true'`, `'t'`, `'yes'`, `'y'`, `'1'`, `'1.0'` | `true` |
| | `'false'`, `'f'`, `'no'`, `'n'`, `'0'`, `'0.0'` | `false` |
| **Integer** | `1` | `true` |
| | `0` | `false` |
| **Decimal** | `1.0` |`true` |
| | `0.0` | `false` |
{: .grid}

Note for the purposes of string representations, case is ignored (so that both `'T'` and `'t'` are considered `true`).

If the input collection contains multiple items, the evaluation of the expression will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

If the input collection is empty, the result is empty.
