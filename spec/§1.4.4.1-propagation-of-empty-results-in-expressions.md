#### Propagation of empty results in expressions

FHIRPath functions and operators both propagate empty results, but the behavior is in general different when the argument to the function or operator expects a collection (e.g. `select()`, `where()` and `|` (union)) versus when the argument to the function or operator takes a single value as input (e.g. `+` and `substring()`).

For functions or operators that take a single values as input, this means in general if the input is empty, then the result will be empty as well. More specifically:

* If a single-input operator or function operates on an empty collection, the result is an empty collection
* If a single-input operator or function is passed an empty collection as an argument, the result is an empty collection
* If any operand to a single-input operator or function is an empty collection, the result is an empty collection.

For operator or function arguments that expect collections, in general the empty collection is treated as any other collection would be. For example, the union (`|`) of an empty collection with some non-empty collection is that non-empty collection.

When functions or operators behave differently from these general principles, (for example the `count()` and `empty()` functions), this is clearly documented in the next sections.
