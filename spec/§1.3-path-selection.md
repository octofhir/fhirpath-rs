## Path selection

FHIRPath allows navigation through the tree by composing a path of concatenated labels, e.g.

``` fhirpath
name.given
```

This would result in a collection of nodes, one with the value `'Wouter'` and one with the value `'Gert'`. In fact, each step in such a path results in a collection of nodes by selecting nodes with the given label from the step before it. The input collection at the beginning of the evaluation contained all elements from Patient, and the path `name` selected just those named `name`. Since the `name` element repeats, the next step `given` along the path, will contain all nodes labeled `given` from all nodes `name` in the preceding step.

The path may start with the type of the root node (which otherwise does not have a name), but this is optional. To illustrate this point, the path `name.given` above can be evaluated as an expression on a set of data of any type. However the expression may be prefixed with the name of the type of the root:

``` fhirpath
Patient.name.given
```

The two expressions have the same outcome, but when evaluating the second, the evaluation will only produce results when used on data of type `Patient`. When resolving an identifier that is also the root of a FHIRPath expression, it is resolved as a type name first, and if it resolves to a type, it must resolve to the type of the context (or a supertype). Otherwise, it is resolved as a path on the context. If the identifier cannot be resolved, the evaluation will end and signal an error to the calling environment.

Syntactically, FHIRPath defines identifiers as any sequence of characters consisting only of letters, digits, and underscores, beginning with a letter or underscore. Paths may use backticks to include characters in path parts that would otherwise be interpreted as keywords or operators, e.g.:

``` fhirpath
Message.`PID-1`
```
